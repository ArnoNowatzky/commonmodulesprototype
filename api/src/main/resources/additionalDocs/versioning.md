# Versioning

We use **semantic versioning** for the interface files. 

In short: Versions look like this: major.minor.patch, e.g. 1.1.2.

* Change of the patch number means only compatible bugfixing and documentation changes
* Change of minor number means compatible new features, which means in an HTTP interface, new endpoints, additional optional URL parameters or additional optional new JSON Body fields or additional fields in returned JSON
* Change of major number means incompatible changes

## Version naming of alpha, beta and release candidate releases
Alpha and beta releases are suffixed accordingly, e.g. 2.0.0-alpha, release candiates are suffixed with RC, e.g. 1.3.0-RC1. Normal releases have no suffix.
